# Tandy 1000HX BIOS

## What is this

Long story short:

- The Tandy 1000 HX BIOS disassembled


Long story long:

I received a Tandy 1000 HX. I had no idea what it was. I googled it. I found
it interesting, mostly because it has an 8088, propietary joystick plugs and
rare graphics video modes.

I decided to port the UniJoystiCle to the Tandy. In order to do that I
needed to know in more detail how the Tandy rare video modes worked. I started
disassembling the `mov ax,0000h; int 10h` BIOS handler. And after that I
continued with other parts of the BIOS, mostly out of curiosity, and because I
forgot how to code for Intel 80x86.

This is still WIP.

## TODO:

- Finish analyzing graphics code
- Finish analyzing EEPROM code
- Finish analyzing keyboard code
- Analyze all the floppy disk handler
- And analyze what's left
- Review IDA Pro autogenerated comments. Some of them are not valid for the Tandy
- And probably much more


## How to read it

- Open the [.lst file][5] with a text editor
- Or open the [.idb][6] file with [IDA Pro][3] (I used the [freeware version][4])
